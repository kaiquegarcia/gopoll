This project doesn't have any purpose. I did this just to study how to do some stuff with CLI.

With this project I:

- learned how to use [AlecAivazis/survey@v2](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2) (deprecated);
- discovered [charmbracelet/bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/) (Alec's recomendation).

All of this gave some ideas. For example, with BubbleTea I can do a CLI chat integrated with an existing system, like Discord, Telegram, whatever. My understanding about both projects, for now, is:

- if I want to draw some views, I can pick BubbleTea (which have another project for better UI);
- if I just want to ask questions, I can still use Survey.

Do you agree?
